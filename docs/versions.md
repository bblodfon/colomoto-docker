# Versions

Docker images are timestamped with tags of the form `YYY-MM-DD`.
By defaults, images are released monthly, if any changes.

In order to guarantee the re-executability of your notebook, we recommend to use these tagged images instead of the non-persistent `next` tag. Moreover, do not forget to indicate the version (tag) of the image you used.

Existing image tags are listed at https://github.com/colomoto/colomoto-docker/tags.
